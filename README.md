## Installation

#### Via Toltec

The recommended way of installing the software in this repository is to use
[toltec](https://github.com/toltec-dev/toltec) - a free software repository for
remarkable. Once opkg and the toltec repository are setup, use `opkg install
remux` to get remux, for example.

If you are feeling adventurous, you can try out the bootstrap script from
linusCDE that installs opkg, toltec and the rmkit packages in one line: `wget -qO-
https://rmkit.dev/bs | sh -C harmony minesweeper remux nao`
