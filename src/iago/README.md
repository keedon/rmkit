# iago

iago is a UI for drawing shapes with the pen. it is built on top of `lamp`
and can draw circles, rectangles and lines.

## installation

iago requires `lamp` to be installed into `/opt/bin/lamp`

## launching

use `genie` or ddvk's `touchinjector` to launch iago.

## usage

select a shape to insert, adjust it by dragging its handles and then select
'ok' or 'cancel'.

you can insert more than one shape at a time by selecting a new shape from
the dropdown menu

## known issues

when using genie, you will have to "clear" the touch after iago is launched for
the first time.  in practice, this means you have to double input tap / swipe
gestures. in other words, 3 finger tap becomes 3 finger double tap.
