# iago

iago is a UI for drawing shapes with the pen. it is built on top of `lamp`
and can draw circles, rectangles and lines.

## launching

use `genie` or ddvk's `touchinjector` to launch iago. it's preferable to launch
it with a swipe and not tap (as there are some weird bugs when using taps with
genie)

## usage

select a shape to insert, adjust it by dragging its handles and then select
'ok' or 'cancel'
